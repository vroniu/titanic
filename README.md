# ðŸš¢ Titanic
My attempt at the Titanic survivors problem, using Decision Trees (sk-learn) and Neural Networks (keras). 

I used Python 3.8.8 with Keras 2.4.3 and sk-learn 0.23.2. Written in VSC using the interactive python mode.

Accuracy results:
- __~83%__ for Neural Network with basic data preprocessing
- __~80%__ for Decision Tree with basic data preprocessing
- __~87%__ for Neural Network with better data preprocessing
- __~85%__ for Decision Tree with better data preprocessing
